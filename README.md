# Credit to agriculture in Brazil

The agriculture is the sector who moves the economy of various countries, including Brazil. So this dataset is to analyse how was the credit provided to agriculture in the years of 2012 to 2018.

The Credit to Agriculture dataset provides data on the amount of loans provided by the private/commercial banking sector to producers in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, including household producers, cooperatives, and agro-businesses. The dataset also provides statistics on the total credit to all industries and indicators on the share of credit to agricultural producers.

How was the credit provided to agriculture in the years of 2012 to 2018? Why is credit for agriculture in Brazil so low in relation to the total, since it is a country of main economic activity in this sector?
